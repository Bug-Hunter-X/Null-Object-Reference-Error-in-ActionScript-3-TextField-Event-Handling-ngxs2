This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.  This error often occurs when attempting to access properties of an object before it has been properly initialized or if the object reference is unexpectedly null. The example shows how this can occur when handling the complete event of a TextField that is loading text from an external source. The solution provides a robust way to handle this scenario by checking for null values before accessing any properties.
